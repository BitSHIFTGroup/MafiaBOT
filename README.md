MafiaBOT is a Yahoo! Messenger bot designed to take on the storyteller role in a classical Romanian card game “Mafia”.  
By acting as a tier between the Yahoo! servers and Yahoo! Messenger clients, MafiaBOT can keep track of multiple clients in multiple rooms and allow users to play together using simple commands addressed to a Yahoo! ID.
